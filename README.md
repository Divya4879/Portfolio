## The Story Behind This Portfolio

Built this during the DevOne Hackathon 2025 with a focus on showcasing real projects that solve actual problems. The dark theme with electric blue accents reflects my love for clean, modern interfaces that don't strain your eyes during those late coding sessions.

## What Makes It Special

- **Real Projects**: Every project here is something I've actually built and deployed
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations and hover effects that feel natural
- **Performance First**: Optimized for fast loading because nobody likes waiting
- **Contact Form**: Actually works (powered by EmailJS)
- **Responsive**: Looks great on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors
